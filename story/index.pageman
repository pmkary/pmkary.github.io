# A Brief Introduction

People know me for very different things. Some believe I'm a [programming language designer](http://createyourproglang.com/), some remember me from the [GNU project](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/gnu-spotlight-with-karl-berry-december-2011), some use the tools I developed for some  [open](https://nearley.js.org/docs/tooling) [source](https://twitter.com/KaryStudio/status/880918931732668416) [projects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=karyfoundation.idf), some remember me by [my past](http://thepa.archives.kary.us/) and [the services](https://web.archive.org/web/20120104160532/http://www.basekit.com//examples) I used, few know me by the [questions I ask](https://unmethours.com/users/881/pouya-kary/), and the [questions that I answer](https://www.quora.com/profile/Pouya-Kary), one person in particular thinks I'm a [typographer](http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-67205.html)^He also thinks I'm a mexican which in the days that I eat Tacco when wearing Poncho, I really wanna be.^, which makes me happy. For myself, I have no idea...

What I can say is: Ever since I was a kiddo, I wanted to be an Inventor. I liked creating really complex systems, fine arts, music, design, algebra, etc. And being an inventor was the only job title where I could combine these things together; the only job where I could be really creative.

These days, I'm on a very diverse range of activities: Some days I create new tools, some days I create new mathematical models, some days I design, some days I compose music, so on and so forth. And that is nighter the definition of an inventor nor an academic researcher but to me it's what I always wanted: Be free to explore my ideas.
