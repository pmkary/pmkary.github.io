      description: DesignTalk is a playground for implementing ideas of an illustration software. The idea is to play with possibilities of interface design and track how much it can improve the state of software's comfort. DesignTalk implements a a new approach of interface design where only the common tools are visual and they are all visible in the side of a selected object to minimize the interface and then every other task is given using an english like language by speaking it.

      description: A very powerful idea in computer graphics is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouraud_shading">Gouraoud Shading</a> because of it's color blending power. I started thinking that Gouraud's alogrithm shades every part of a given polygon evenly and therefore it can be used to create gradients with multiple lights, now what if; we apply eqautions to each transition? By doing so we can get not-linear shaders and create much stranger and better gradients and shades. My research is still ongoing and I'm developing the mathematics for the algorithm but I have successfully modeled it on basic equations and results are sublime.

      description: Orchestra is a visual language that compiles to regular expression. Thanks to the advancements in computing power, one usally writes longer and more powerful regular expressions these days. While the usage has grown, our tools are still the same as they were in 1950s. Orchestra brings a new language that is safe and highly scalable for writing very complex regular expressions.

      description: KaryScript is a programming language that compiles to JavaScript and tries to be a much more readable version of JavaScript. By bringing some of the grammars and ideas from different languages like pipes, ruby like structures, less punctuations, tables from markdown and etc. it makes the whole experience of programming much more readable.
