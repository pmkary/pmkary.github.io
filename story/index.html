                    <div class="legend-paragraph"><p>What I can say is ever since I was a kiddo, I wanted to be an Inventor. I liked creating really complex systems, fine arts, music, design, algebra, etc. And being an inventor was the only job title where I could combine these things together; the only job where I could be really creative. I did my best to become an inventor and these days, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m doing many things and creating many stuff, which is what I wanted. I consult companies, I create tools, compose music, design things, make products, create brands, all sorts of things that I liked.</p>
