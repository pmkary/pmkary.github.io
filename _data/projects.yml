      description: DesignTalk is a playground for implementing ideas of an illustration software. The idea is to play with possibilities of interface design and track how much it can improve the state of software's comfort. DesignTalk implements a a new approach of interface design where only the common tools are visual and they are all visible in the side of a selected object to minimize the interface and then every other task is given using an english like language by speaking it.

      description: A shading algorithm that extends the ideas and mathematics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouraud_shading">Gouraoud Shading</a> by giving it custom transition equations. In Gouraud Shaders colors move from one light source to the other by a linear transition, within this shader one can define custom paths and equations and therefore create much more interesting lightings.

      description: Orchestra is a visual language that compiles to regular expression. Thanks to the advancements in computing power, one usally writes longer and more powerful regular expressions these days. While the usage has grown, our tools are still the same as they were in 1950s. Orchestra brings a new language that is safe and highly scalable for writing very complex regular expressions.
