<div class="legend-section"><div class="legend-paragraph"><p>Kary Foundation has always been about research. With a very small team<sup><a href="#legend69640f62">1</a></sup>, we have done more innovative research than many of the hugest companies. Our fields of research includes many, but our mission as advancing the state of computation, and bringing it to anyone has always remained the same.</p>
</div><div class="legend-sidebar"><ul><div class="legend-bullet" id="legend69640f62">1 &mdash; Only 3 researchers!</div></ul></div></div>

<div class="legend-section"><div class="legend-paragraph"><p>We have done an enormous scale of R&amp;D <sup><a href="#legende64f8e6">2</a></sup> to find out best ways to done computing, interacting with it and most importantly making it comfortable for anyone to use. However our mission has never been a way for us to limit ourselves and we have always been looking for any computational challenges that interested us and even working with many great firms developing computational solutions for the ever evolving world out there.</p>
